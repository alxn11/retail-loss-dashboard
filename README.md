Built this project for my department supervisor to faciliate end-of-month data gathering.
This project analyzes recovery logs from a retail environment (The Home Depot) to identify cashier performance, recovery patterns, and loss-prevention opportunities.
The dataset includes recovery amounts, cashier behaviors, dates, and product descriptions gathered from manually written inputs from cashiers.
