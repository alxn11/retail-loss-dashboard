This project is an end-to-end retail loss prevention analysis, built entirely from scratch using real recovery log data. I completed this project independently at home to demonstrate my skills in Excel analytics, dashboard design, and data storytelling—all applied to a realistic retail operations scenario.

The dashboard reveals recovery trends, cashier performance, behavioral patterns, and loss-prevention insights that would normally require manual counting and tedious review.



Project Overview:
Retail stores track “recoveries” when cashiers detect and prevent potential losses. In real settings, these logs are often manually counted, making it difficult for supervisors to quickly understand:
Who has the most recoveries
When recoveries occur
Which behaviors lead to the most successful recoveries
High-risk areas in the store
Loss trends over time

This project converts that manual process into a fully automated analytical system using:
Excel dashboards
Pivot tables
Dynamic formulas
Structured data
 

Files Included
recovery_data.csv — cleaned raw dataset
retail-loss-dashboard.xlsx — dashboard, pivots, KPIs
README.md — project documentation

 
 Key Features
 Automated KPI Cards:
Dashboard includes:
Total Recovery Amount
Total Number of Recoveries
Highest Single Recovery
Top Cashier (by count and by dollar amount)
 Pivot Table Analysis:
Pivot tables were used to analyze:
Recoveries per cashier
Total vs count of recoveries
Recovery behavior patterns


 Visualizations:
Charts built into the dashboard:
Top 5 Cashiers (Bar Chart)
Recoveries by Day of Week (Column Chart)
Behavior Frequency (Bar Chart)

Each visualization helps tell a story about store performance and shrink trends.

 Why This Project Matters
This isn’t a generic practice dataset.
It’s a self-directed real-world analysis, showing:
Initiative outside of work
Ability to structure messy operational data
Analytic thinking
Retail understanding
Dashboard building
SQL readiness
It demonstrates the exact workflow used by data analysts, business analysts, loss-prevention analysts, and operations analysts.


 Tools Used
Excel (Primary Tool)
SQL (Foundations for future automation)
GitHub (Version control + documentation)


Future Improvements:
Build a SQL database version (PostgreSQL or MySQL)
Publish an interactive Tableau dashboard
Add Python for weekly automated reporting
Expand dataset with more months/years
